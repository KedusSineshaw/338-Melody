# Melody Detect (Updated MVP)

This zip contains the fixed server path and an improved uploader with spinner + error handling. It also includes a proper Vite `index.html` so the dev server runs.

## Run

### Backend
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

### Frontend
Open a new terminal:
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173
